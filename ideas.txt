Ideas:
-multiple layout options (eg.: normal clock view)
-set non-daily alarms with title + time:
	-when specified alarm goes off => popup screen will appear with the text's title
	-user can choose the specified day+hour+minute when the alarm will go off
-add vibrator to have a better alert at alarms
