Ideas:
-add different alarm sounds (functions) --> user can preview them and set an alarm sound
-attach servo to the circuit (small box which can be opened via servo) --> store medicine inside box
-attach water dispenser
	=> full medicine reminder kit (medicine alarm + box + water dispenser)
-add switch which acts as a screen on/off
