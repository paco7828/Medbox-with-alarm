Ideas:
-multiple layout options (eg.: normal clock view), change with potentiometer
-set non-daily alarms with title + time:
	-new button (alarmBtn) will listen for this function
	-when specified alarm goes off => popup screen will appear with the text's title
	-user can choose the specified day+hour+minute when the alarm will go off (similar choosing functionality as the daily alarm)
-add vibrator to have a better alert at alarms
